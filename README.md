Welcome to the JamuIN backend API repository! This API powers the innovative JamuIN Android application, which provides users with homemade Jamu recipes and recommendations for purchasing Jamu products from local micro, small, and medium enterprises (UMKM). The app also features a marketplace for supporting local Jamu UMKM.
